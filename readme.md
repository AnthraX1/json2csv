# Why?

I love using the https://github.com/zemirco/json2csv library. It's a great tool for following the [Data Science at the Command Line](https://www.datascienceatthecommandline.com/) philosophy.



Here's what I want out of a json to csv converter:

* High performance
* Ability to stream inputs (for large files)
* Ability to auto-detect headers

TODO: write instructions on avoiding namespace collisions

Thanks to Andrew Gallant's incredible work on [rust-csv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-csv) and [xsv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv), which provided a lot of tools and inspiration!
